# Assignment 1: User Interface Layout

## Overview
 
You are to create a new flutter project and replace the `lib` folder with the folder provided in this `start kit`.

The `start-kit` code given to you should compile and run as is, even though the functionality of the running app is not complete.

You will see `TODO` items in the given code, that directs where to put your code to complete the assessment. 

Commit your work and upload to a remote github repo and then submit the link to Moodle.

## Required Tasks

- Each `TODO:` comment will describe the expected functionality your code is to provide.

- Place your code immediately below the `TODO:` comment.

- `Do NOT change any of the code outside of a TODO: comment`.

### Part 1:

- Create a Material Widget with a Scaffold. In the body of the Scaffold start with a Row Widget.

- All you will need is the `row`, `column` and `container` widgets, and any other widgets that are associated with the aforementioned widgets.
 
- Do `NOT` use the `stack` or `positioned` widgets.

- All containers will have a height and width of 100px.

- All font sizes will be default except `Con 6` which will be font size 30.

- All borders will have a width of 3px. Be careful because some elements do not have a border.

- All padding will be 10px. Be careful because some elements do not have padding.

- The easiest solution is to have 1 row with 3 columns as children of the row.
